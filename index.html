Boom/bust dev cycle
- Improve all the things!
- Change all the things!
- The sky's the limit, the world is your oyster!

Quote from Greg from Kris about 3 years to fix a mistake.

Burnout: After a 3 year dev cycle, we're all dead.

Corp investment: Want results in less than 3 years.

Drupal 7 -> Drupal 8: Necessary but frickin' huge.

Break all the things!


What we need going forward:
- Shorter ROI
- Less epic development
- Iterative improvement

What makes that possible?
- Loosely-coupled components
- Separation of concerns
- Clear API boundaries
==> Interfaces and real APIs

aka, all of those things we've been building for the last 2 years.

Howzat?
[Example of changing API without changing API]

[Example of BC via interfaces]

[List of things we can add like REST UI, link manipulation, etc.]

"An API is a function that performs an operation on a series of arrays." - WRONG!

But didn't we do that for Drupal 7?
- No, we backported minor things.
- Did anyone notice?
- Attention was always on Drupal 8.

Cornerstone:
- Do not open Drupal 9 dev for *at least* a year.
- Force ourselves to think about BC.
- Collect list of things that require BC breaks, save them for later.
- When D9 opens, JUST do the BC changes.  Save stuff for 9.1.
- This will be hard; a learning experience for core devs.
- Are you up for the challenge of having your (cup)cake and eating it too?

Schedule:
- January: 8.0
- February: 8.0.1 (bugfix)
- March: 8.0.2 (bugfix)
- April: 8.1.0 (features)
- May: 8.1.1 (bugfix)
- June: 8.2.1 (bugfix)
- July: 8.2.0 (features)
- etc.

Problems:
- But how can we innovate? (Only Drupal is dumb enough to think you can't innovate without breaking APIs.)
- But we don't even know if our new APIs will stand up to it! (Let's find out!)
- But that pushes D9 even further away! (Maybe? Or maybe it just becomes much shorter. Won't feel it if we get new toys without breaking BC.)
- Our packaging scripts aren't up to the task. (DA, this is your job.)
- Translations? (Now update well enough that is a solved problem; string changes OK.)
- But I like my playground! (Welcome to growing up. $10s million ride on this. Take it seriously.)
- What about security releases? (Ah, not sure yet.)

=> Decide what we want to do about security releases, the rest is easy.

What we get:
- *faster* improvements.
- Lower stress.  (Next feature release is only a few months away.)
- Easier corp investment.
- Easier small-shop investment! (Don't rely on Acquia/CapGemini as much.)
- A great learning experience.
- Good PR.
- A better sense for what we need to do, because we've used it.

To prepare:
- Decide what is and isn't an API. ("it's a function" doesn't count.)
- Decide what constitutes an API break.  (@api, @deprecated)
- Ensure good interfaces and swappability. (Already in progress, ~ to testability.)

Welcome to adulthood.
